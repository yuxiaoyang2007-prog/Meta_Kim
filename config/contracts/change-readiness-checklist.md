# Change Readiness Checklist

This checklist turns repeated Meta_Kim review findings into a pre-merge contract.
Use it before changing setup, update, runtime hooks, prompt adapters, provider
registries, workflow schemas, deletion paths, or release behavior.

## Host State Impact Matrix

For install, update, sync, and runtime-home changes, record these four columns
before editing implementation code:

| Existing host state | State this change adds | State this change must preserve | Rollback path |
|---|---|---|---|
| User config, native host plugin links, local MCP servers, hooks, agents, profiles, credentials, and generated state currently present. | Files, config blocks, hook entries, cache entries, manifest rows, or migration state introduced by this change. | User-owned config, credentials, custom servers, native host controls, and unrelated runtime state. | Command or manual steps that restore the prior state without deleting user-owned data. |

Minimum regression shape: existing user config -> install -> update. A happy-path
fresh install is not enough for host-preservation changes.

## Hook / Prompt Protocol Flow

For hook, prompt, or adapter changes, draw the data path before implementation:

| Source payload | Runtime adapter field | Model-visible field | UI-visible field | Assertion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hook input, command stdout, or dependency adapter output. | Runtime-specific envelope such as Codex `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, Cursor `prompt`, or lifecycle `decision`. | The exact field the model consumes. | The exact field the host displays, if any. | A test or live smoke that proves the hop. |

Keep policy decisions, model context, and UI notices separate. Advisory progress
messages must not become blocking decisions unless the contract explicitly says
the hook is a gate.

## Deletion / Refactor Residue Sweep

Before deleting a field, mode, backdoor, state key, or compatibility surface:

- Search old identifiers with `rg`.
- Check i18n strings and localized docs.
- Check README, changelog, and release notes.
- Check runtime mirrors, generated adapters, and install/update projections.
- Check compatibility exports, persisted state, and migration paths.
- Check test names, fixtures, assertion text, and skip/reminder wording.

Deletion is complete only when code, state, docs, mirrors, and tests agree.

## Evidence Budget

For third-party runtime, provider, hook, install, update, and release changes,
define evidence before writing completion prose:

- Local assertion: focused test, validator, or static contract check.
- Host-side self-test: installed-user, isolated runtime home, or tool-side smoke.
- User-visible result: release note, generated output, UI-visible behavior, or
  exact command output that a maintainer can replay.

Do not describe the work as complete until the evidence budget is either
satisfied or explicitly marked blocked with a reason.

Evidence template:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `operationSteps` | The exact install, update, sync, hook, or runtime action performed. |
| `toolSideOutput` | The command, tool, or host-side output that proves the action happened. |
| `hostVisibleResult` | What the user or runtime can actually see after the action. |
| `failureBoundary` | What remains untested, blocked, optional, or unsafe to automate. |
| `reviewStatus` | Review pass, reviewer, or explicit blocked reason. |

## Install / Update Status Semantics

Use one of four status classes in user-visible install/update output:

| Class | Meaning | User next action |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | The requested action completed or the existing destination is already usable. | Continue. |
| `skipped` | The action was intentionally not run because it is optional, already satisfied, or not selected. | Continue unless the skipped optional capability is needed. |
| `manual` | The host requires a manual UI or command step that Meta_Kim cannot safely automate. | Perform the named manual action, then rerun the check. |
| `failed` | The requested action did not complete and needs intervention or retry. | Fix the reported cause before declaring install/update complete. |

## Execution Mode Classification

Workflow nodes use specific `executionMode` values, but reviews must first map
them into three classes:

| Class | Modes | Counts as real execution? |
|---|---|---|
| `real_execution` | `primary_execution`, `factory_then_dispatch`, `verification_execution` | Yes |
| `read_only_sidecar` | `readonly_fetch_sidecar`, `readonly_review_sidecar` | No |
| `approval_gate` | `approval_gate` | No |

Parallel groups and completion statistics must filter by class, not by raw node
count. Read-only sidecars and approval gates may support execution, but they do
not prove that executable work happened.
