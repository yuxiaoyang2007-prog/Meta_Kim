## [2.0.19] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Cross-runtime MCP Memory persistence** — `install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs` now installs MCP Memory lifecycle hooks for Codex, Cursor, and OpenClaw in addition to Claude Code. Codex receives SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / Stop hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json`; Cursor receives beforeSubmitPrompt / stop hooks in `~/.cursor/hooks.json`; OpenClaw receives a managed hook under `~/.openclaw/hooks/mcp-memory-service`.
- **MCP Memory Service API parity** — Claude's SessionStart memory lookup now uses upstream `POST /api/memories/search` while remaining compatible with older `results[].memory` response shapes. Cross-runtime save hooks write to `POST /api/memories` with `X-Agent-ID` and `conversation_id`, matching upstream guidance.
- **MCP Memory endpoint compatibility** — Cross-runtime memory hooks now honor both `http://` and `https://` `MCP_MEMORY_URL` endpoints.
- **Memory health check wording** — The hook installer no longer reports the service as down when the current shell cannot verify `localhost:8000` but a `memory.exe` process is running. It now distinguishes "not responding" from "running but unverifiable from this shell".

## [2.0.18] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Codex `/meta-theory` agent-team execution** — `/meta-theory` now explicitly authorizes Codex sub-agent delegation, applies `agent-teams-playbook` for non-trivial tasks, and maps capability-matched execution to Codex `spawn_agent` calls instead of leaving complex work on the main thread.
- **Quick deploy root guide files** — `setup.mjs` now copies `CLAUDE.md` for Claude deployments and `AGENTS.md` for Codex, OpenClaw, and Cursor deployments. The `all` path copies `AGENTS.md` once, avoiding redundant file operations while preserving every runtime's required project entrypoint.
- **Planning hook phase counting** — Planning-with-files hook patching now covers shell and PowerShell stop/check scripts across runtimes, and the Codex adapter template also counts both `## Phase` and `### Phase` headings. This prevents false `7/0 phases done` stop-hook reports after reinstall.
- **Claude Code smoke validation** — `eval-meta-agents` now handles Claude Code versions that no longer expose an `agents` subcommand by validating `.claude/agents/*.md` directly. Windows CLI resolution also prefers the npm-style `~/.local/claude.cmd` shim before the native `~/.local/bin/claude.exe` binary.

### Tests

- Added setup tests for quick-deploy guide-file coverage, Codex planning hook phase parsing, and Claude smoke fallback behavior.
- Verified release readiness with `npm run meta:verify:all` on 2026-04-28.

## [2.0.17] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Codex `/meta-theory` command projection** — Added canonical Codex command source at `canonical/runtime-assets/codex/commands/meta-theory.md`, plus project/global sync support so Codex can load `/meta-theory` from `.codex/commands/` and `~/.codex/commands/`.

### Fixed

- **Codex command validation and packaging** — `config/sync.json`, `scripts/meta-kim-sync-config.mjs`, `scripts/sync-runtimes.mjs`, `scripts/sync-global-meta-theory.mjs`, `scripts/validate-project.mjs`, and setup tests now treat Codex commands as a first-class runtime asset. `.gitignore` root anchoring was corrected so canonical Codex runtime assets are not accidentally ignored.
- **OpenClaw skill-root wiring** — Verified OpenClaw's installed CLI behavior and wired the project projection through `skills.load.extraDirs` in `canonical/runtime-assets/openclaw/openclaw.template.json`, using `__REPO_ROOT__\\openclaw\\skills` so generated configs can load repo-local OpenClaw skills without pretending they live in the managed user skill directory.
- **Cursor agent and skill path parity** — Verified Cursor's built-in `create-subagent` / `create-skill` guidance and updated Cursor agent generation to emit YAML frontmatter under `.cursor/agents/*.md`. Cursor docs now distinguish project skills (`.cursor/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`), user skills (`~/.cursor/skills/`), internal built-ins (`~/.cursor/skills-cursor/`), and user agents (`~/.cursor/agents/`).
- **Global capability discovery roots** — `scripts/discover-global-capabilities.mjs` now scans the real OpenClaw and Cursor user roots: OpenClaw `~/.openclaw/skills` plus `~/.agents/skills`, Cursor `~/.cursor/agents`, `~/.cursor/skills`, and `~/.cursor/skills-cursor`.

### Changed

- **Runtime documentation refreshed** — Updated `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `docs/runtime-capability-matrix.md`, and research docs to match the verified Codex, OpenClaw, and Cursor runtime locations and command/skill behavior.
- **OpenClaw evaluation hydration** — `scripts/eval-meta-agents.mjs` now recursively hydrates `__REPO_ROOT__` placeholders in generated OpenClaw config objects, not only the agent workspace path.

## [2.0.16] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Skill cleanup across platforms** — Four critical fixes to `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs`:
  - `legacyNames` support — Added manifest field to remove old skill directories (e.g. `find-skills` → `findskill`). `cleanupLegacySkillNames()` runs before install to clean stale symlinks and directories.
  - `.disabled/ residue cleanup` — Added `cleanupDisabledSkillResidue()` (per-skill) and `sweepStaleDisabledDirs()` (general sweep) to remove `.disabled/{skillId}/` when the active version exists. Catches residue from skills deployed outside the manifest (e.g. meta-theory via sync:runtimes).
  - `loadSkillsManifest()` field propagation bug — `hookSubdirs`, `hookConfigFiles`, and `fallbackContentDir` were never copied from manifest to runtime spec objects. Hooks were never deployed because of this pre-existing bug. Fixed by adding spread operators for these three fields.
  - `deployHookSubdirs/deployHookConfigFiles` destination path bug — Both functions received `targetDir` (skills root) but used it as `runtimeHome`, causing hooks to deploy to wrong paths. Changed function signature to receive `runtimeHome` directly and updated all 4 call sites.

### Added

- **hookprompt hook deployment mechanism** — hookprompt is now properly installed as a hook system rather than a skill clone:
  - New `hookExtraFiles` manifest field — Deploys extra files alongside hooks (e.g. `prompt-optimizer-meta.md` to `~/.claude/`).
  - New `hookSettingsMerge` manifest field — Registers hook commands in `settings.json` with correct paths to deployed hook scripts.
  - New `deployHookExtraFiles()` and `mergeHookSettings()` functions in install script.
  - Updated `skills-manifest.schema.json` with schema definitions for all three new fields.
  - hookprompt manifest entry now includes `hookSubdirs`, `hookExtraFiles`, and `hookSettingsMerge` for Claude platform.

### Changed

- **i18n additions** — Added `warnLegacyNameRemoved` and `warnDisabledResidueRemoved` keys to all 4 languages (en, zh-CN, ja-JP, ko-KP) in `meta-kim-i18n.mjs`.

## [2.0.15] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **stop-memory-save hook**: New Stop hook (`stop-memory-save.mjs`) writes session summaries to MCP Memory Service on session end. Enables cross-session continuity without manual intervention. All 10 hooks now wired in `doctor:governance` and `validate:run` expectations.
- **tests/setup/check-sync.test.mjs**: Updated expected hook count from 9 to 10 (stop-memory-save added).
- **scripts/runtime-sync-check.mjs, doctor-governance.mjs, footprint.mjs, claude-settings-merge.mjs**: Added `stop-memory-save.mjs` to hook file/command lists.
- **`mirror` as the 11th business workflow phase** — `config/contracts/workflow-contract.json` already declared `mirror` (Mirror Publish / 镜像发布) as a terminal phase appended after `evolve`; this release closes the gap by syncing every dependent test and doc to the 11-phase contract. Post-sync state: `phases.length = 11`, `terminalPhases.length = 7`, `labels.{zh-CN,en-US}` each have 11 entries, and `tests/meta-theory/07-contract-compliance.test.mjs` + `tests/meta-theory/12-ten-step-workflow.test.mjs` pass without flakiness.

### Fixed

- **4-runtime hooks correction** — All four platforms (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor) have native hooks systems. Previous docs incorrectly stated only Claude Code had hooks. Codex has `hooks.json` (5 events since v0.117.0), OpenClaw has Plugin SDK hooks (28 hooks), and Cursor has `hooks.json` (4 events). Updated `runtime-capability-matrix.md`, `runtime-coverage-audit.md`, `distribution-matrix.md`, and all 4 README language variants.
- **PWF hook co-deployment** — `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` now deploys planning-with-files lifecycle hooks to Codex (`.codex/hooks/` + `hooks.json`) and Cursor (`.cursor/hooks/` + `hooks.json`) via new `deployHookSubdirs()` and `deployHookConfigFiles()` helpers.
- **Superpowers sparse fallback** — Added `fallbackContentDir` logic to detect when platform-specific subdirs (`.codex/`, `.cursor/`) are too sparse and fall back to the main `skills/` content directory.
- **`install-plugin-bundles` dry-run flakiness** — `scripts/install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` (line 1576–1583) was short-circuiting the "already exists" branch even under `--dry-run`, so the sparse-checkout preview for plugin-bundle specs like `obra/superpowers` would never print on machines that had the target directory cached. Added a single-line `!dryRun &&` guard so dry-run always prints the intended command (the idempotent skip still applies to real installs). Restores 3 previously-failing tests in `tests/setup/install-plugin-bundles.test.mjs` (`Codex .codex/`, `Cursor .cursor/`, `OpenClaw skills/`).

### Changed

- **11-phase contract synced across tests + top-level docs**: `tests/meta-theory/07-contract-compliance.test.mjs`, `tests/meta-theory/12-ten-step-workflow.test.mjs`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `canonical/agents/meta-conductor.md`, `canonical/skills/meta-theory/references/dev-governance.md`, `canonical/skills/meta-theory/references/ten-step-governance.md`. Counts updated (`10 → 11`, `6 → 7` terminal), phase lists append `mirror`, zh-CN/en-US labels extended with `镜像发布` / `Mirror Publish`.
- **discover-global-capabilities.mjs** — Added Cursor platform scanning (skills + plugins).
- **README cross-platform mapping** — Added hooks to Codex, OpenClaw, and Cursor entries in all 4 language READMEs (EN/ZH/JA/KO).

### Known Issues

- `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` / `README.ja-JP.md` / `README.ko-KR.md` still describe the pre-`mirror` 10-stage workflow in prose and Mermaid diagrams; a multi-language README sync is deferred to a follow-up release.
- Callers that first-run `meta:verify:all` on a fresh clone must run `npm run meta:sync:global` beforehand, otherwise `meta:check:global` hard-fails on the missing `~/.codex/skills/meta-theory/` (and `.cursor` / `.openclaw`) directories. Documenting this as a Getting Started prerequisite is queued.

## [2.0.14] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **MCP Memory SessionEnd auto-save + Layered injection (L1/L2/L3)**: Two complementary progress-tracking mechanisms for cross-session continuity.
  - **`scripts/install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs`** — Extended to handle Stop hook (`stop-save-progress.mjs`) and commands directory (`save-progress/`). Now registers both SessionStart and Stop hooks in `settings.json`. Stop hook auto-extracts completed/remaining tasks from session transcript via regex patterns and persists to `.claude/project-task-state.json`.
  - **`canonical/runtime-assets/claude/hooks/stop-save-progress.mjs`** — Node.js Stop hook that reads session transcript, extracts task keywords (完成/搞定/新增/修复 etc.), and calls `mcp_memory_global.py --mode save`. Runs after every Claude Code session, exits 0 always.
  - **`canonical/runtime-assets/claude/memory-hooks/mcp_memory_global.py`** — Upgraded with layered injection:
    - L1 compact: task state only (~120 chars) — always shown
    - L2 filtered: project memories with relevance > 0.55 (~400 chars) — context-triggered
    - L3 full: recent memories (~800 chars) — on demand via `--mode query-memories`
  - **`canonical/runtime-assets/claude/commands/save-progress/SKILL.md`** — Manual save command (`/save-progress`). Allows explicit task state persistence when user wants precise control.
  - **Chinese-friendly limits**: `MIN_RELEVANCE=0.55` (lowered for Chinese embedding models), `MAX_LEN_COMPACT=120`, `MAX_LEN_L2=400`, `MAX_LEN_L3=800`.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs` async + `fs` import bug** — `copyCommandsDir()` used `fs.readdir()` but imported sync `fs` module, causing "fs is not defined" error. Fixed by importing `readdir` from `node:fs/promises`. Also fixed `registered is not defined` error by properly capturing return values from `registerSessionStartHook()` and `registerStopHook()`.

## [2.0.13] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Layer 3 auto-start on setup**: `node setup.mjs` now automatically starts the MCP Memory Service (HTTP mode) in the background after installation, then verifies the health endpoint at `http://localhost:8000`. If the server starts successfully, a platform-specific boot auto-start entry is created (Windows Startup VBS / macOS LaunchAgent / Linux XDG autostart). The entire sequence is non-blocking — failures print manual instructions instead of aborting setup. Five new i18n keys added per language (en / zh-CN / ja-JP / ko-KR): `mcpMemoryAutoStarting`, `mcpMemoryAutoStarted`, `mcpMemoryAutoStartFailed`, `mcpMemoryAutoStartManual`, `mcpMemoryAutoStartBoot`.

- **Install Manifest Phase 4 — manifest-driven uninstall**: `scripts/uninstall.mjs` now prefers the install manifest over the filesystem-scan heuristic, so teardown follows the exact set of entries Meta_Kim actually wrote (rather than a path-pattern guess).
  - New `manifestEntryToFinding(entry)` adapter maps a schema-v1 manifest entry onto the scan-finding shape that `planActions` already consumes. Entries with `kind` of `pip-package` / `mcp-server` / `git-hook` return `null` — they need dedicated actions the pipeline does not model yet, so only `file` / `dir` / `settings-merge` entries reach `planActions`.
  - New `findingsFromManifest({ scope, repoRoot })` reads the global and/or project manifest and returns adapted findings. Read failures are swallowed — a corrupt or missing manifest never blocks uninstall.
  - `planActions()` now accepts `useManifest` (default `true`) and returns `{ actions, source }`. When `useManifest` is true and at least one actionable entry exists, manifest drives the plan; otherwise `collectFindings` is the fallback.
  - New `--no-manifest` CLI flag forces the scan fallback (useful for verifying parity, or after a manifest goes stale).
  - `CATEGORIES.D` and `CATEGORIES.H` plan builders now derive `recursive` from `f.kind === "dir"` so manifest file entries get accurate `remove file` output instead of the previous (harmless but misleading) `remove directory` description.
  - MSG tables add `sourceManifest` / `sourceScan` strings in en / zh-CN / ja-JP / ko-KR; the dry-run header now states which source the current run used.
  - Unit coverage: `tests/setup/uninstall-manifest.test.mjs` adds 14 tests for `manifestEntryToFinding` + `findingsFromManifest`, bringing the install-manifest test suite to 48 tests total.

- **Install Manifest Phase 3 — pre-install preview (MVP)**: users now see what Meta_Kim has on disk *before* they confirm a fresh install, so they can catch "I didn't mean to overwrite those" moments.
  - **`scripts/sync-runtimes.mjs`** gains `--json` (pair with `--check`). When both flags are passed, stdout emits `{ scope, targets, total, byCategory, byAction, staleFiles }` — a structured diff of every file sync-runtimes is about to create or update. The existing human-readable `--check` path is preserved unchanged when `--json` is absent, so CI contracts keep working.
  - **`setup.mjs`** gains `showExistingFootprint(installScope)`, invoked inside `runInstall()` immediately after `showInstallOverview()` and before `askYesNo(confirmStartInstall)`. It reads the global and project manifests via dynamic import and prints per-scope entry counts broken down by category (A..I). When no manifest exists, it prints `First install on this machine` instead of crashing.
  - Three new i18n keys added per language (en / zh-CN / ja-JP / ko-KR): `footprintTitle`, `footprintFirstInstall`, `footprintRefreshNote`.
  - A later iteration can upgrade this from "previous footprint" to a real diff by spawning `sync-runtimes --check --json` and merging its output against the existing manifest; the JSON schema above is the forward-compatible hook for that.

- **Install Manifest Phase 2 — sync recorder wiring**: `sync-global-meta-theory.mjs` and `sync-runtimes.mjs` now record every write to the install manifest, turning the manifest from a passive schema into the canonical source of truth for what Meta_Kim has put on disk.
  - **`scripts/sync-global-meta-theory.mjs`** opens `openRecorder({ scope: "global" })` at the start of `runSync()` and flushes at the end. Every canonical skill directory sync (per-runtime), the global hooks dir + each hook file inside it, and the `~/.claude/settings.json` merge are recorded as Category A / B / C entries. `copyCanonicalSkill` gained a `targetId` argument so each skill dir is tagged with the right `{targetId}-global-skill` purpose.
  - **`scripts/sync-runtimes.mjs`** opens `openRecorder({ scope: "project" })` in `main()` when `--scope` includes `project` and `--check` is not set. `writeGeneratedFile` routes every successful write through a new `inferProjectCategory()` helper that maps the path to Category D (skills), E (hooks), F (agents), or G (settings/MCP) across `.claude`, `.codex`, `.cursor`, `openclaw`, and `.agents`. Unknown paths stay unrecorded rather than polluting the manifest. A CLI guard was added around the top-level `await main()` so the module is safe to import from unit tests without triggering a real sync.
  - **Recorder isolation contract**: both scripts wrap all recorder calls in a `recordSafe()` helper so a manifest write failure never breaks the underlying sync.
  - **Unit coverage**: `tests/setup/sync-runtimes-manifest.test.mjs` adds 15 unit tests for `inferProjectCategory` / `inferProjectPurpose`, bringing the install-manifest test suite to 34 tests total.

- **Install footprint + uninstaller (Phase 1 of Install Manifest project)**: Three new scripts give users full visibility and reversibility over what Meta_Kim writes to their system.
  - **`scripts/install-manifest.mjs`** — Schema v1 plus helpers (`readManifest`, `writeManifest`, `record`, `removeByPath`, `validate`, `listByCategory`, `manifestPathFor`). Two manifest files: `~/.meta-kim/install-manifest.json` (global) and `<repo>/.meta-kim/install-manifest.json` (project). Nine categories (A–I) cover global skills, global hooks, global settings merges, project skills/hooks/agents/settings, local state, and shared dependencies. Phase 2 now wires `sync-global-meta-theory.mjs` and `sync-runtimes.mjs` into this API; `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` and `claude-settings-merge.mjs` are still pending.
  - **`scripts/footprint.mjs` + `npm run meta:status` / `:json` / `:diff`** — Tree/JSON/diff views of everything Meta_Kim has installed on the current machine. Prefers manifest data when present; falls back to deterministic filesystem scan of runtime homes (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.claw`, `~/.cursor`) and the current repository. Identifies Meta_Kim–managed hook entries inside `~/.claude/settings.json` (including double-backslash-escaped Windows paths written by older sync runs — see Fixed below). 4 languages (en/zh/ja/ko) with auto-detection via `--lang`, `METAKIM_LANG`, `LANG`.
  - **`scripts/uninstall.mjs` + `npm run meta:uninstall` / `:yes` / `:deep`** — Dry-run by default, refuses to delete without `--yes`. Supports `--scope=global|project|both` (default `both`), `--deep` (also `pip uninstall` graphifyy/mcp-memory-service and remove `.git/hooks/post-{commit,checkout}` written by graphify), `--purge-project-agents` (normally kept because they are repo-owned source files). Automatically backs up `~/.claude/settings.json` to a timestamped file before stripping Meta_Kim-managed hook entries, and never touches unrelated hook blocks.

### Planned

- **Install Manifest Phase 2 remainder** — `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` and `claude-settings-merge.mjs` still need to call `openRecorder()` / `record()` on their own write paths so every install surface contributes to the manifest.
- **Install Manifest Phase 3 follow-up** — replace the "previous footprint" preview with a real planned-vs-existing diff by spawning `sync-runtimes --check --json` from `setup.mjs` and merging its output against the on-disk manifest.
- **Install Manifest Phase 4 follow-up** — model `pip-package`, `mcp-server`, and `git-hook` entry kinds as first-class uninstall actions (currently they are filtered out by the manifest-source adapter and only the filesystem scan can clean them up, via `--deep`). Also add an empty-directory sweep after file-granular manifest teardown so parent dirs like `.claude/skills/meta-theory/references/` do not get left behind when every child file is deleted individually. A version-aware upgrade path (detect schema or version drift and migrate) belongs here too.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/claude-settings-merge.mjs` hookCommandNode double-escape (was Known Issue in Phase 1)** — `hookCommandNode(absScriptPath)` previously produced Windows paths that were double-JSON-encoded when serialized back to `settings.json` (observed as `\\\\` on disk), and the matchers `isGlobalMetaKimManagedHookCommand` / `isRepoMetaKimHookCommand` only checked the single-backslash form so they silently missed the double-escaped entries. Fixed at the source in 37d84fde: `hookCommandNode` now writes a single-escaped path and the matchers tolerate both single- and double-backslash forms. The local normalizing matcher that Phase 1 shipped inside `footprint.mjs` + `uninstall.mjs` is retained as a defense-in-depth layer for legacy on-disk settings written by older sync runs.

- **MCP Memory Service default port corrected to `8000` (was `8888`)** — the upstream `doobidoo/mcp-memory-service` project defaults to `MCP_HTTP_PORT=8000` (verified against `run_server.py` and `docs/integration/multi-client.md`). Meta_Kim previously hard-coded `localhost:8888` in 10 places, so the health check in `scripts/install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs` reported `MCP Memory Service is NOT responding` even when the server was running correctly on the official port. Updated:
  - `canonical/runtime-assets/claude/memory-hooks/mcp_memory_global.py` — `MCP_MEMORY_URL` env-var default
  - `canonical/runtime-assets/claude/memory-hooks/config.template.json` — `memoryService.http.endpoint`
  - `scripts/install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs` — header comment, `checkServerHealth()` URL, install/check success/warn messages (5 occurrences)
  - `setup.mjs` — 4 i18n locale strings for the `mcpMemoryServerStartHint` guidance
  - `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ja-JP.md`, `README.ko-KR.md` — "start server" instruction
  Users can still override via `MCP_MEMORY_URL` env var or by editing `~/.claude/hooks/config.json`.

- **`setup.mjs` `runMcpMemoryHookInstaller` i18n + progress UX** — the memory-hook installer step previously (a) printed four hard-coded English strings bypassing the per-locale `t.*` system and (b) used `stdio: "inherit"` to pipe the Python child process's raw stdout directly to the terminal, producing ~10s of silent no-feedback time and breaking the 4-language install experience. Fixed: function is now `async`, wrapped in `withProgress(t.mcpMemoryHookInstalling, …)` so users see a clean per-locale label with the existing dim arrow marker; child `stdio` is now `["ignore", "pipe", "pipe"]` so stdout is captured silently; on non-zero exit the captured `stderr` is surfaced in dim style under `t.mcpMemoryHookWarnings` so the underlying Python error is still discoverable. The single call site (`installMcpMemoryServiceStep`) now `await`s the installer. Three new i18n keys added per language (en / zh-CN / ja-JP / ko-KR): `mcpMemoryHookInstalling`, `mcpMemoryHookInstalled`, `mcpMemoryHookWarnings`.

- **`scripts/install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs` console output left-aligned** — the script's `info`/`ok`/`warn`/`fail` helpers previously prefixed every line with 2 spaces of indentation, which made the standalone invocation (when run directly outside of `setup.mjs`, or when stderr is surfaced by the new pipe handler above) look like nested sub-output of nothing. Indent removed so every status line sits flush with column 0.

- **`scripts/sync-runtimes.mjs` missing-canonical warning i18n'd** — `tryReadCanonical(filePath)` previously printed `[sync-runtimes] Skipping missing canonical file: …` in hard-coded English whenever a canonical source file was absent (which is the typical failure mode when `npx` serves a stale cached tarball that predates a new `canonical/runtime-assets/*` addition). Now routed through `t.canonicalMissingWarn(filePath)` with en / zh-CN / ja-JP / ko-KR translations added to `scripts/meta-kim-i18n.mjs` so the warning stays legible in every locale.

- **`package.json` explicit `files` whitelist for `npm pack` / `npx` tarballs** — the previous publication relied on npm's default file-selection rules (pack everything not ignored), which silently omitted `canonical/runtime-assets/openclaw/openclaw.template.json` and `canonical/runtime-assets/codex/config.toml.example` from the `npx --yes github:KimYx0207/Meta_Kim` cached tarball on some Node / npm combinations. Added an explicit `files` array covering `canonical/`, `scripts/`, `bin/`, `config/`, `docs/`, `setup.mjs`, `install-deps.sh`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README*.md`, `LICENSE`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` so every release of the package includes the complete canonical source. Version intentionally *not* bumped in this commit — the 2.0.13 bump is reserved for the maintainer's next tagged release.

### Added

- **scripts/doctor-hooks.mjs + `npm run meta:doctor:hooks` / `:fix`**: New scanner for `~/.claude/settings.json` (and optionally the repo's `.claude/settings.json` via `--all`). Identifies hook entries whose `command` path references a non-existent file ("zombie hooks" — typically left behind by copying `settings.json` between machines with different usernames or OSes) and lists them for review. `--fix` writes a timestamped backup (`settings.json.backup-<ISO>`) and removes only the zombie entries, preserving every live hook block. Supports `--lang` (en/zh/ja/ko, auto-detected from `METAKIM_LANG`/`LANG`), `--silent` (CI mode with zombie-count exit code), `--project` (only project-level settings), `--all` (both user-level and project-level).

### Migration Notes

- Users on a new machine should run `node setup.mjs` then `npm run sync:global:meta-theory` — do **not** copy `~/.claude/settings.json` between machines (hook `command` values are absolute paths and will not resolve under a different username or OS). `npm run meta:doctor:hooks` detects and `:fix` cleans up after an accidental copy.

- **MCP Memory Service port migration (`8888` → `8000`)**: existing installs have a local `~/.claude/hooks/config.json` that was seeded from the *old* template with `endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:8888"`. That file is *preserved by design* (user customizations are never overwritten), so the template fix alone will not migrate it. Two safe paths forward:
  1. Edit `~/.claude/hooks/config.json` manually: change `memoryService.http.endpoint` from `:8888` to `:8000`.
  2. Or `rm ~/.claude/hooks/config.json` and re-run `node scripts/install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs`; it will re-seed from the corrected template. Either step makes the SessionStart health check green against the stock `memory server --http` default port.

- **`npx` stale-tarball cache**: if `npx --yes github:KimYx0207/Meta_Kim meta-kim` warns about missing canonical files (e.g. `openclaw.template.json`, `codex/config.toml.example`) during `sync:runtimes`, your local npx cache is holding a pre-`files`-whitelist tarball. Clear it with `npm cache clean --force` (or `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`) and re-run the command to pull a fresh tarball that includes the complete `canonical/` tree.

## [2.0.12] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **SKILL.md agent name consistency**: Updated Type A, B, and D sections to use full agent names (`meta-prism`, `meta-warden`, `meta-genesis`, `meta-artisan`, `meta-scout`, `meta-sentinel`, `meta-librarian`) in section headings and body text. Previously only role names (Prism, Warden, Genesis) appeared in plain text, causing the 03-agent-dispatch.test.mjs agent-mapping tests to fail. All 773 meta-theory tests now pass.

### Changed

- **hooks DRY refactor**: Created `canonical/runtime-assets/claude/hooks/utils.mjs` — shared module exporting `readJsonFromStdin`, `readJsonFromStdinSync`, and `extractFilePath`. 6 hooks (`block-dangerous-bash`, `post-console-log-warn`, `post-format`, `post-typecheck`, `pre-git-push-confirm`, `subagent-context`) now import from `./utils.mjs` instead of duplicating the function inline. Eliminates 63 lines of duplicate code across the hooks layer.

### Fixed

- **graphify DRY gap**: `scripts/hooks-utils.mjs` removed — shared utilities correctly placed inside the hooks directory so sync can propagate them. All hooks now use `./utils.mjs` (canonical: `canonical/runtime-assets/claude/hooks/utils.mjs`).

## [2.0.8] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **package.json: unify npm script naming**: All npm scripts now use `meta:` prefix (`sync:runtimes` → `meta:sync`, `validate` → `meta:validate`, `check:runtimes` → `meta:check:runtimes`, `index:runs` → `meta:index:runs`, etc.) for consistent discoverability.

- **runtime-capability-matrix.md**: Updated script name references to match new `meta:` prefix.

- **doctor-governance.mjs**: Updated `validate:run` reference to `meta:validate:run`.

- **validate-project.mjs**: Updated script name assertions and added checks for `meta:sync`/`meta:validate` presence.

- **setup.mjs**: Enhanced `npmFailed` and `skillFailed` error messages with actionable troubleshooting hints (network, permission, version mismatch).

- **tests/meta-theory/00-capability-discovery.test.mjs**: Updated test assertions to expect new `meta:` prefixed script names.

- **tests/setup/check-sync.test.mjs**: Updated expected hook count from 8 to 9 (stop-compaction guard added).

### Added

- **install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs: GitHub API plugin version detection**: Added `fetchLatestPluginVersion()` that reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from GitHub to detect the latest plugin version. Compares against `installed_plugins.json` (v2 format under `plugins/` subdirectory) and only reinstalls when a newer version is available. Falls back to parsing `installPath` directory name when GitHub is unreachable.

- **meta-kim-i18n.mjs**: Added three new i18n keys: `labelUpToDate`, `labelCannotCheckGitHub`, `labelUsingLocalRecord` (EN/ZH/JP/KR).

- **docs/QUICKSTART.md**: Chinese quickstart guide for new users.

- **scripts/doctor-interactive.mjs**: Interactive doctor menu providing unified entry point for health checks.

## [2.0.10] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **graphifyy: respect active venv before pip install**: If `VIRTUAL_ENV` is set, resolve the venv's Python directly (`Scripts/python.exe` / `bin/python`) instead of probing the system PATH. This lets users who activate a venv manually before running `setup.mjs` have `graphifyy` installed into their venv instead of the system Python.

## [2.0.9] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **install-skills: multi-runtime empty sections root cause**: `installSkillsToMultipleRuntimes` Phase 2 called `deployStagedSkill` with an empty `stagedPath` when a skill already existed at the first runtime (stage optimization skipped clone). Since `deployStagedSkill` returns `false` silently on empty path, all skill sections showed headers but no content. Fixed by checking `stagedPath` existence before deploying — falls through to direct install branch so "⊘ 已存在" output is always printed.

- **install-skills: `--skills ""` filtering all skills**: `parseSkillsArg` returned `[]` instead of `null` for `--skills ""` (empty string), causing `applySkillsIdFilter` to filter ALL skills out of `SKILL_REPOS`. Fixed by moving the length check to after `filter(Boolean)`. Also updated `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` to skip filtering when `skillsArg` is empty.

- **doctor-interactive.mjs: non-interactive TTY crash**: `@inquirer/prompts` `select()` crashes with "User force closed the prompt" in non-TTY environments (Claude Code bash, CI). Fixed by detecting TTY before invoking the menu — non-interactive mode auto-runs `runFullDiagnostic()`.

- **doctor-interactive.mjs: "npm run run" spurious prefix**: All npm script calls in switch cases had an extra `"run"` entry in the args array, generating `npm run run meta:doctor:governance`. Fixed by removing all spurious `"run"` prefixes.

- **install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs: Mac plugin marketplace registration**: On Mac/Linux, `claude plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace` and `everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code` failed with "Plugin not found in marketplace" because these marketplaces are not pre-registered on fresh installs (unlike Windows which has them by default). Fixed by adding auto-registration logic: before each plugin install, probes `claude plugin marketplace list --json` and calls `claude plugin marketplace add <GitHub-url>` for any missing marketplace. Registry map: `superpowers-marketplace` → `obra/superpowers-marketplace`, `everything-claude-code` → `affaan-m/everything-claude-code`.

- **docs: corrected superpowers marketplace identifier**: Research docs listed `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` (wrong) instead of `superpowers@superpowers-marketplace` (correct). Fixed in `docs/research/dependencies/superpowers.md` and `docs/research/distribution-matrix.md`.

### Added

- **setup.mjs: `--log-file` tee for debug capture**: Added optional `--log-file <path>` to `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` — replaces `process.stdout/stderr.write` with a tee that mirrors all output to both terminal and the specified log file. setup.mjs auto-generates `~/.cache/meta-kim-setup/install-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` (code commented out by default, ready for re-enable during future debug sessions).

## [2.0.8] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **skills.json: superpowers plugin version**: Fixed `superpowers` from `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` (wrong, lacks per-skill discovery) to `superpowers@superpowers-marketplace` (correct, 14 skills discoverable). Resolves [Issue #4](https://github.com/KimYx0207/Meta_Kim/issues/4).

- **skills.json: everything-claude-code install method**: Fixed `everything-claude-code` from `subdir: "skills"` (wrong, not a subdir of its repo) to `claudePlugin: "everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code"` (plugin marketplace, correct).

- **schema: installMethod field**: Added `installMethod` enum to `skills-manifest.schema.json`: `pluginMarketplace`, `gitClone`, `gitCloneInstallScript`, `subdirExtraction`, `manual`. Documents how each of the 9 dependency skills is installed across platforms.

- **schema: opencode target**: Added `opencode` to targets enum — `superpowers` and `everything-claude-code` now declare full cross-platform support (claude, codex, openclaw, cursor, opencode).

- **skills.json: installMethod coverage**: All 9 skills now carry explicit `installMethod`: superpowers/ecc/cli-anything → `pluginMarketplace`; agent-teams-playbook/gstack → `gitCloneInstallScript`; findskill/planning-with-files/skill-creator → `subdirExtraction`; hookprompt → `manual`.

- **setup.mjs multi-runtime redundant download fix**: Added Phase 0 pre-check in `installSkillsToMultipleRuntimes` to detect skills already deployed at target runtimes. Updated `stageSkillClone` and `stageSkillFromSubdir` to accept optional `preExistingPath` and skip git clone when skill already exists. Eliminates wasteful downloads on every `setup.mjs` run (without `--update`) for already-installed skills. Backward compatible: `--update` mode, single-runtime path, and CLI interface unchanged.

- **sanitizer: skip quarantine for third-party plugin docs**: Added `shouldSkipDocsSkillDoc()` to `install-skill-sanitizer.mjs` — skips quarantine for `docs/{locale}/skills/*.md` files in third-party plugin repos (e.g. ecc's example skills under `docs/zh-CN/skills/`). Suppresses the noisy "隔离托管安装中的无效 SKILL.md" warnings that appear on every `setup.mjs` run. Only quarantines files that would actually be discovered as skills.

### Added

- **meta-conductor Stage 4 agent-team-playbook integration**: Pipeline Mode integration with `agent-teams-playbook` v4.5. Conductor now invokes the playbook at Stage 4 (Execution) to obtain orchestration decisions (scenario selection, team blueprint, collaboration mode), parses the natural language output, and converts `teamBlueprint` to `workerTaskPackets` for dispatch board execution. Strict mode: parsing failures throw `ParseError` immediately (no silent defaults). Error codes: `SCENARIO_MISSING`, `BLUEPRINT_EMPTY`, `BLUEPRINT_COLUMN_MISMATCH`, `DISPATCH_BOARD_MISSING`.

- **Integration protocol document**: `docs/protocols/meta-conductor-agent-teams-playbook-integration.md` defines the full integration architecture, invocation format, expected output patterns, parsing strategy, error handling, and field mapping table.

- **Integration test**: `tests/integration/agent-teams-playbook-integration.test.mjs` validates the complete pipeline (6/6 tests passing): scenario parsing, team blueprint parsing, collaboration mode parsing, workerTaskPackets conversion, strict mode error handling, and end-to-end integration flow.

### Changed

- **meta-conductor version**: Bumped from v1.1.0 to v1.2.0. Added `agent-team-playbook Pipeline Mode integration (Stage 4 Execution)` to `own` field in agent frontmatter.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **stop-compaction hook**: New Stop hook (`stop-compaction.mjs`) auto-writes a compaction packet on session end when 8-stage spine markers are detected. SessionStart `subagent-context.mjs` reads the packet and injects pending stage/findings as priority context on resume. Compaction is now **enforced via hooks**, not convention. Canonical source (`.claude/hooks/`), global sync (`~/.claude/hooks/meta-kim/`), and all mirror configurations are kept in sync. All 9 hooks wired in `doctor:governance` and `validate:run` expectations.

- **doctor scripts**: `scripts/write-compaction.mjs` and `scripts/write-migration.mjs` are maintainer helpers for testing the compaction enforcement chain and migration tracking respectively.

### Changed

- **graphify (install + docs + tests)**: `setup.mjs` optional Python step and `npm run graphify:install` now **idempotently** run `python -m graphify claude install` and `python -m graphify hook install` even when `graphifyy` is already installed via pip (fixes silent skip of git hooks). `scripts/graphify-cli.mjs` `install`/`update` appends `hook install`. `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` runs the same wiring when pip reports graphify already present. **Docs** (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` / `README.ja-JP.md` / `README.ko-KR.md`, `AGENTS.md`): separate **data refresh** (hooks/commands) vs **Fetch Step 0.5** (model behavior) vs **Claude subagent hint** (no embedding); Codex/OpenClaw/Cursor consumption via synced `dev-governance.md` and optional `graphify codex|claw install` in target repos. **Hook** [`canonical/runtime-assets/claude/hooks/subagent-context.mjs`](canonical/runtime-assets/claude/hooks/subagent-context.mjs): prefer `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` when present. **Tests**: [`tests/setup/graphify-wiring-contract.test.mjs`](tests/setup/graphify-wiring-contract.test.mjs) locks the contract.

- **Documentation (CLAUDE.md)**: Clarified generated/runtime wiring vs canonical edit targets; Cursor as fourth runtime projection; expanded maintenance commands (`check`, `check:global:meta-theory`, `deps:update`, `graphify:install`, `prompt:next-iteration`, etc.); graphify working-directory notes.

### Fixed

- **Runtime configs — no hardcoded model**: OpenClaw template, Codex `config.toml.example`, `validate-project.mjs`, `discover-global-capabilities.mjs`, and `eval-meta-agents.mjs` no longer inject or validate a default model; CLIs own model selection.

- **CLI / i18n**: `setup.mjs` log alignment and progress output; `sync-runtimes.mjs` incremental/`--check` messages use `meta-kim-i18n` with `zh`/`ja`/`ko` LANG aliases.

### Added

- **Skills manifest / install**: `pluginHookCompat` and `installRoot` schema; `planning-with-files` canonical layout under `skills/` with plugins junction for upstream Stop hooks; Cursor target labels in i18n; sanitizer stops rewriting planning-with-files hook paths.

### Chore

- **install**: Suppress noisy stdout from git proxy detection while still applying proxy env.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **planning-with-files install path**: Global install deploys the canonical tree to `skills/planning-with-files` under each runtime home and adds `plugins/planning-with-files` → `skills/planning-with-files` (`pluginHookCompat` in `config/skills.json`) so upstream Stop-hook paths resolve without rewriting `SKILL.md`. Manifest schema adds optional `pluginHookCompat` (boolean) and optional `installRoot` (`skills` | `plugins`) for rare primary-in-plugins layouts.

### Added

- **Principle enforcement via 3 execution lanes (PRIN-01~05)**: Added mandatory principle compliance checks across the meta-agent governance chain to close the gap between "principles defined" and "principles enforced":
  - `meta-prism`: New **Principle Violation Assertions (PRIN-01~05)** section — Configurable, Single Source, Layering, Decoupling, i18n enforced as mandatory check dimensions equivalent to AI-Slop detection; missing = review incomplete, no evidence = FAIL
  - `meta-genesis`: New **7th stress-test category (Principle Violation Detection)** with PRIN-ST-01~05 sub-tests; Iron Rule blocks SOUL.md delivery on any principle failure
  - `meta-warden`: New **Principle Compliance Gate** in Quality Gate checklist — principle violations are governance findings (not quality notes), cannot be accepted-risk, must fix or reject

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Dual-end Warden architecture (Type A/B/C/D/E routing)**: meta-theory SKILL.md now explicitly models Warden as BOTH entry gate (clarification + solution enumeration via brainstorming) AND exit gate (quality gate + final synthesis) for ALL dispatch types. Conductor now orchestrates ALL types, not just Type C.
- **findskill dependency for all 8 meta agents**: Added `findskill` discovery step to Dependency Skill Invocations of all 8 canonical agents (warden, conductor, genesis, artisan, scout, sentinel, librarian, prism). Artisan and Scout already had findskill; others are new.
- **superpowers/brainstorming for Warden entry gate**: Warden now uses `superpowers/brainstorming` at the entry gate for solution enumeration (≥2 approaches before dispatch).
- **Hook path auto-fix during install**: `install-skill-sanitizer.mjs` can scan installed skill SKILL.md files for known broken hook command paths and patch them in-place (curated list; optional `silent` per pattern). Dry-run supported.

### Changed

- **meta-theory SKILL.md Type Routing table**: Rewrote the routing table with clear entry/exit gate separation. Each Type (A/B/C/D/E) now shows Warden entry role, Conductor orchestration, execution steps, and Warden exit role.
- **meta-theory SKILL.md Type A/B/C/D/E detail sections**: Added Entry Gate (Warden) / Orchestration (Conductor) / Execution / Exit Gate (Warden) structure to all five Type sections.
- **sync-runtimes.mjs cross-runtime path substitution**: Added `applyRuntimePaths()` function that substitutes canonical/ paths to runtime-specific paths (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `openclaw/`, `.cursor/`) during sync. OpenClaw agent references use workspace-per-agent format (`openclaw/workspaces/{workspace}/AGENTS.md#`).
- **canonical/meta-theory/SKILL.md canonical paths**: All `.claude/` path references in the canonical SKILL.md replaced with `canonical/` format, enabling correct cross-runtime sync.
- **discover-global-capabilities.mjs hook scanning scope**: Reverted Phase 2 hook extraction from third-party skill SKILL.md YAML frontmatter. Capability index now only records physical hook script files under the hooks directory. Third-party skill hook commands (including broken ones) are excluded from Meta_Kim's governance scope.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-15

- **README Layer 3 correction**: Fixed false "All three layers activate automatically" claim. Layer 1 requires Claude Code runtime, Layer 2 is auto-installed by setup.mjs, Layer 3 requires manual server startup on port 8888. All 4 languages (EN/ZH/JA/KO) synchronized.
- **setup.mjs Layer 3 install**: Added Step 4.6 for MCP Memory Service (mcp-memory-service) installation — pip install, .mcp.json registration, i18n strings across all 4 languages.
- **install-mcp-memory-hooks.mjs**: New script to install Claude Code SessionStart hooks for MCP Memory Service — verifies server health, registers hooks, warns if server not running.

### Changed

- **README Layer 3 description**: Expanded activation details with tool-specific instructions (Claude Code auto-hooks vs. Codex/OpenClaw/Cursor manual setup), explicit server startup command, and hook registration notes.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **README overhaul**: Removed "BETA VERSION" banner, streamlined language, clarified Meta_Kim's governance mission
- **Remove shared-skills/ projection layer**: Deprecated `shared-skills/` directory removed from `sync-runtimes.mjs`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `sync.json` — runtime projections now target only `.claude/`, `openclaw/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/meta-theory/`
- **install-error-classifier**: Expanded TLS/SSL error patterns (`ssl_read`, `ssl_connect`, `ssl_error_syscall`, `openssl/ssl`) and added proxy network error detection for partial clone failures (`index-pack failed`, `file write error`, `pack-objects died`, `connection was reset`)
- **graphify-runtime**: Added `checkNetworkx()` function enforcing `networkx >= 3.4` (required for `louvain_communities(max_level=...)`)
- **skills-manifest schema**: Added `defaultSelected` boolean field to control which repos are pre-selected in dependency multi-select
- **cli-anything skill**: Set `defaultSelected: false` — opt-in install only
- **.gitignore**: Added `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `graphify-out/`

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Windows `EBUSY` on skill staging cleanup**: `deployStagedSkill` no longer fails the whole global install when deleting a sibling `*.staged-*` folder hits `resource busy or locked` (Defender/indexer/transient handles). Uses `rmDirWithRetry` + `rmDirBestEffortLocked` with short backoff; lock errors log `warnStagingLocked` instead of aborting after a successful deploy.
- **Proxy detection UX overhaul**: `setup.mjs` now asks user to confirm detected proxy (default = yes, Enter to accept). Previously auto-detected and applied system proxy silently, which caused TLS failures.
- **Proxy auto-detection removed from install script**: `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` no longer auto-detects system proxy — only respects `--proxy` flag, `META_KIM_GIT_PROXY` env, or user's explicit choice from setup.mjs.
- **"loopback proxy stripped" false positive**: Fixed — strip logic now checks `META_KIM_GIT_PROXY` env var, so configured proxies are not stripped.
- **git subprocess proxy propagation**: `spawnSync` and `spawn` in `runGit()`/`runGitAsync()` now pass `env: process.env`, so proxy env vars actually reach git.
- **Staging directory EBUSY crashes**: `cleanupStaleStagingDirs()` now catches Windows lock errors and skips locked directories with a warning instead of crashing.
- **False-positive SKILL.md quarantine**: `listSkillFiles()` in `install-skill-sanitizer.mjs` now skips `openclaw/`, `cursor/`, `codex/`, and `openclaw/skills/` subdirectories — these contain legitimate cross-platform sub-skills (e.g. gstack's own OpenClaw skills) and are not invalid nested garbage.
- **`os.platform()` typo**: Fixed to `os.platform()` in `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs`.
- **`sleepSyncMs` for Windows**: Replaced `spawnSync("sleep", ...)` with PowerShell `Start-Sleep` on Windows; POSIX `sleep` on others; last-resort busy-wait as fallback.

### Changed

- **`askProxyConfig()` default = yes**: When a proxy is detected, the prompt now defaults to using it (`[Y/n]`). User can still opt out by typing `n`.
- **Git fallback strategy**: `runGit()` and `runGitAsync()` now try direct connection first, then fall back to proxy if network fails. If user has no proxy configured, direct succeeds and proxy is never attempted.
- **`i18n` proxy keys**: Added `proxyDetectedPrompt`, `proxySkip`, `proxySkipDeclined`, `proxySaved`, `proxyFallbackProxy`, `proxyFallbackProxySuccess` across all 4 languages (en, zh-CN, ja-JP, ko-KR).
- **Concurrency limiting**: `MAX_CONCURRENT_CLONES = 3` limits parallel git clones to prevent system resource exhaustion.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Git retry with skillLabel**: `runGit()` in `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` auto-retries TLS/proxy failures up to 3 times with increasing delays (2s/4s/6s), and retry messages now identify the exact skill name instead of raw git args.
- **setup.mjs full i18n migration**: All hardcoded English strings in `setup.mjs` replaced with `t.*()` calls across 4 languages (en, zh-CN, ja-JP, ko-KR) — 19 new i18n keys added.
- **warnGitRetry i18n key** added to `meta-kim-i18n.mjs` for all 4 languages.
- **Skill sanitizer script** (`scripts/install-skill-sanitizer.mjs`): detects and quarantines invalid nested `SKILL.md` files inside managed installs.
- **Research docs** (`docs/research/`): dependency analysis, platform profiles, and distribution matrix for third-party skills.
- **install-error-classifier** enhancements: `parseGitHubRepoUrl`, `buildGitHubTarballUrl`, expanded TLS/proxy classification.

### Changed

- `resolveRuntimeHomeDir()` extracted from `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` into `meta-kim-sync-config.mjs` for shared use.
- Legacy subdir install detection and repair now runs automatically during skill install/update.
- Archive extraction on Windows uses relative path + `cwd` to avoid tar misinterpreting `C:\path` as a remote host.

### Fixed

- **repoPath undefined crash** in `meta-kim-local-state.mjs`: `ensureProfileState()` used undeclared `repoPath` variable; now correctly uses `repoRoot` constant.
- **Retry message confusion**: `git -C` showed instead of skill name in retry warnings — all 5 `runGit` call sites now pass explicit `skillLabel`.
- **Windows tar path bug**: archive fallback extraction failed with `Cannot connect to C: resolve failed` on Windows due to colon in absolute path.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Configurable multi-platform framework**: Meta_Kim now supports mapping to any runtime platform via `config/sync.json` manifests — add a new `generatedTargets` entry and a corresponding profile, and `sync-runtimes.mjs` projects to it automatically. No hardcoded platform list.
- **Cursor as a fourth runtime target**: `.cursor/agents/*.md`, `.cursor/skills/meta-theory/`, `.cursor/mcp.json`. Cursor agents use plain Markdown (no YAML frontmatter) for compatibility with Cursor's agent system.
- `runtimes/cursor.profile.json` with Cursor-specific projection and activation config.
- `--targets cursor` support in all sync/setup commands.
- **Enhanced agent principles**: all 8 canonical agents (`meta-warden` through `meta-scout`) updated with strengthened capability-first dispatch, explicit ownership boundaries, and cross-runtime awareness including Cursor.
- **Shared i18n module** (`scripts/meta-kim-i18n.mjs`) unifies all install/update strings across 4 languages.
- **Setup UI overhaul**: `setup.mjs` now features a branded ASCII art banner with gold gradient, streamlined headings (`▸` style), and compact status output.
- **X/Twitter contact** (`https://x.com/KimYx0207`) in banner and `config/skills.json` author links.
- Plugin pre-check in `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs`: uses `claude plugins list --json` to detect already-installed plugins.

### Changed

- `installPythonTools()` and `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` now use `pip show graphifyy` for reliable detection with suppressed verbose output.
- `sync-global-meta-theory.mjs` and `meta-kim-sync-config.mjs` updated with cursor runtime spec support.
- `--scope project|global|both` now works consistently across `setup.mjs --update` and `sync:runtimes`.
- `meta-theory` skill version bumped to 2.0.0.

### Fixed

- **Graphify verbose output**: pip install no longer prints 20+ "Requirement already satisfied" lines when already installed.
- `sync-global-meta-theory.mjs` crash on cursor target (`Cannot read properties of undefined`) — cursor was missing from `runtimeSpecs` dict.
- `sync-runtimes.mjs` Codex paths corrected: `.claude/` → `.codex/` for all codex-*-Dir variables.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Framework extensibility via `config/sync.json`**: Any platform can be added by editing the manifest — no hardcoded platform list. The sync system is now truly runtime-agnostic: add a new `generatedTargets` entry and a corresponding profile, and `sync-runtimes.mjs` projects to it automatically.
- `shared-skills/` sync block added to `sync-runtimes.mjs`: mirrors `meta-theory.md` and `references/` alongside OpenClaw projections, enabling a portable shared skill layer.
- `--scope project|global|both` now works consistently across `setup.mjs --update` and `sync:runtimes`: `project` writes to repo-local dirs, `global` writes directly to runtime homes, `both` writes to both.
- Shared i18n module (`scripts/meta-kim-i18n.mjs`) unifies all install/update strings across 4 languages, replacing scattered hardcoded English in `setup.mjs` and `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs`.
- Plugin pre-check in `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs`: uses `claude plugins list --json` to detect already-installed plugins before installing, preventing repeated re-install.

### Fixed

- `sync-runtimes.mjs` Codex paths corrected: `.claude/` → `.codex/` for all codex-*-Dir variables.
- graphify command on Windows: bare `graphify` replaced with `python -m graphify` in both scripts.
- `--update` mode now prompts for install scope (project/global/both) like install mode, instead of hardcoding `project`.
- `.gitignore` now correctly ignores derived directories at directory level: `.codex/`, `codex/`, `shared-skills/`, `.meta-kim/`, and `openclaw/workspaces/*/.openclaw/`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Runtime-neutral canonical source layer under `canonical/`, plus repo-tracked sync manifest (`config/sync.json`) and three runtime profiles for Claude, Codex, and OpenClaw.
- Local activation configuration via `.meta-kim/local.overrides.json`, with explicit separation between repo `supportedTargets` / `defaultTargets` and machine-level `activeTargets`.
- `--targets` support across `setup.mjs`, `sync:runtimes`, `sync:global:meta-theory`, and `deps:install:all-runtimes`, so local activation can be multi-selected without shrinking the repo support surface.
- `--scope` support for `sync:runtimes`: `--scope project` writes to repo-local dirs (default), `--scope global` writes directly to `~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.openclaw/`, with safety assertions to prevent writes outside configured runtime homes.

### Changed

- `.claude/` is no longer treated as the canonical source layer; Claude, Codex, and OpenClaw are now peer runtime projections generated from `canonical/`.
- `setup.mjs` now saves machine-local active runtime selection and uses it for local activation, while repo projection sync still follows repo-supported targets.
- Validation, MCP runtime loading, migration staging, and meta-theory tests now read canonical agents / skill sources from `canonical/` instead of assuming `.claude/` is the source of truth.
- `validate` now guards the canonical kernel and runtime-asset templates only; projection freshness stays in `check:runtimes`, so repo correctness no longer depends on generated mirrors or repo-local OpenClaw config.
- OpenClaw evaluation now uses an ephemeral config outside the tracked repo surface, and the legacy `openclaw/openclaw.local.json` plus `sync:global:meta-theory:codex-active` path have been removed from the public project model.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Runtime-level `dispatchEnvelopePacket` governance for non-query runs, plus validator coverage for owner, capability boundary, memory mode, and review / verification ownership.
- Repo-local state layout under `.meta-kim/state/{profile}/`, including `run-index.sqlite`, local `compactionPacket` continuity state, and profile collision safeguards.
- Operator commands `index:runs`, `query:runs`, `rebuild:run-index`, and `migrate:meta-kim` for governed-run retrieval and staged migration from older prompt-pack / single-agent repos.

### Changed

- `discover:global` now rebuilds `.claude/capability-index/meta-kim-capabilities.json` first and keeps `global-capabilities.json` as a compatibility mirror.
- `doctor:governance` now reports layered health across canonical contracts, mirror parity, runtime hooks, and local profile / run-index state.
- Sync all runtime-facing governance docs to the new run-index / dispatch-envelope / compaction model, including `.claude/agents/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and all four README language variants.

### Fixed

- Fill the previously missing README updates in `README.ja-JP.md` and `README.ko-KR.md` so the multilingual docs now cover the new capability index, local run index, migration helper, and layered governance doctor flow.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-04

### Documentation

- **README (all four languages)**: remove `<div align="center">` wrappers around fenced Mermaid code blocks so **Cursor** (and similar previews) can render diagrams instead of **Unable to render rich display**; keep `div` centering for Markdown **tables** only. Repo-wide pass: `README.md` 9 blocks, `README.zh-CN.md` 9, `README.ja-JP.md` / `README.ko-KR.md` 8 each.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-03

### Documentation

- Align **README.ja-JP.md** and **README.ko-KR.md** with **README.md** / **README.zh-CN.md**: shared anchors (`#complex-spine-*`, `#meta-kim-diagram-two-layers-*`, `#task-routing-*`), workflow maps, runtime / eight-agent mini diagrams, and links to English canonical sections where detail stays in `README.md`.
- Fix **Mermaid** layout: `flowchart TB` with two horizontal `subgraph` blocks often renders **side-by-side**; replace with **stacked `flowchart LR`** pairs for the eight-stage spine (rows 1–4 / 5–8) and for spine vs 10-phase business workflow.
- Wrap Markdown **tables** in `<div align="center">` across all four READMEs so GitHub / VS Code previews center consistently (including stage tables with `Critical`, Hooks, Commands, etc.).
- **Repository structure**: replace ASCII tree with **path | description** tables in `README.md`, `README.ja-JP.md`, and `README.ko-KR.md` (match `README.zh-CN.md` granularity); add `codex/`, `docs/`, `shared-skills/`, `CHANGELOG.md` rows where missing.
- **JA/KO**: add the **two-layer workflow vocabulary** table (8-stage spine vs 10-phase business contract); add **`npx … meta-kim`** row to Quick Start usage tables; link abbreviated npm script lists to **`README.md#commands`** for the full command reference.
- Document **Meta_Kim** (`node setup.mjs`) as the canonical install path for **KimYx0207/findskill**; four README languages plus `CLAUDE.md` state that **in-repo naming uses `findskill` only** (aligned with `~/.claude/skills/findskill/`).
- **`npx` one-shot entry**: `npx github:KimYx0207/Meta_Kim meta-kim` documented as equivalent to `node setup.mjs` with per-locale `--check` examples.

### Added

- **Graphify** optional integration: compressed code knowledge graphs for target projects (subgraph extraction, up to ~71× token reduction), `graphify:*` npm scripts, Fetch-stage auto-detection hooks, README sections in all languages.

### Fixed

- Unify **findskill** naming across this repository: remove mixed **`find-skills`** wording in `meta-scout` / `meta-artisan` (`.claude`, `.codex`, OpenClaw SOUL), all `dev-governance` mirrors, and `docs/zh-CN/agents`, so prompts match the installed skill directory.
- Install **planning-with-files** from `skills/planning-with-files/` (sparse/subdir copy) in `install-deps.sh`, `setup.mjs`, and `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` so `~/.claude/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` exists and Claude Code can load the skill and its frontmatter hooks. Whole-repo clone left SKILL only nested, so the skill was invisible.
- Install **findskill** from `windows/` on Windows and `original/` elsewhere (`KimYx0207/findskill` keeps no top-level `SKILL.md`). Same three install entrypoints updated.

### Changed

- Extend `config/contracts/workflow-contract.json` again to formalize card governance: `cardPlanPacket`, `cardDecision`, `deliveryShell`, `silenceDecision`, `controlDecision`, `summaryPacket`, explicit dealer ownership, and run-artifact validation policy.
- Add `scripts/validate-run-artifact.mjs` plus run-artifact fixtures/tests so Meta_Kim now validates real packet chains instead of only schema presence.
- Sync `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to the new card/dealer/silence/summary/run-validator model; these doc changes now map to concrete contract and script additions instead of standalone wording.
- Align `package.json` with the latest released changelog version and stop public-facing docs from treating private/untracked `docs/meta.md` and `docs/repo-map.md` as required public entry points.
- Clarify in both README files that `docs/` is internal-only and remove any public requirement to read `docs/runtime-capability-matrix.md`.
- Harden `config/contracts/workflow-contract.json` from documentation-only governance toward runtime-checkable governance: add `taskClassification`, finding-level closure rules, explicit `writebackDecision`, and hard public-display gate semantics.
- Extend `scripts/validate-project.mjs` and `tests/meta-theory/07-contract-compliance.test.mjs` to enforce the new task-classification, finding-closure, evolution-decision, and runtime-parity requirements.
- Expand `docs/runtime-capability-matrix.md` with a behavior parity matrix covering trigger parity, hook parity, review parity, verification parity, stop condition parity, and writeback parity.
- Sync `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to the hardened governance model so the public docs match the canonical runtime contract.
- Re-scope `eval:agents` into a lightweight no-LLM runtime smoke pass by default, and add `eval:agents:live` plus `verify:all:live` for explicit prompt-backed runtime acceptance.
- Harden `scripts/eval-meta-agents.mjs` with cross-platform process-tree cleanup, runtime filtering, and progress logging so interrupted or timed-out runtime checks do not leave orphaned child processes behind.
- Sync `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to the new smoke-vs-live evaluation split so maintenance guidance matches the actual scripts.
- Rewrite `README.zh-CN.md` into a newcomer-friendly Chinese guide with clearer quick start, runtime roles, maintenance flow, and FAQ.
- Rewrite `README.md` with matching English onboarding, clearer canonical-vs-derived asset guidance, and a simpler command reference.
- Expand both README files to restore key Meta_Kim design concepts: 8-stage spine vs. business workflow, hidden state skeleton, public-display gates, rollback protocol, and Evolution storage.
- Restore the original Mermaid flowcharts in both README files: method chain, 8-stage spine, iron-rules relation, and system flow.
- Rework `AGENTS.md` into a Codex-specific guide that keeps the dispatch-before-execution rule but removes cross-runtime ambiguity.
- Rework `CLAUDE.md` into a clearer Claude Code guide centered on canonical sources, hooks, and the sub-agent dispatch execution rule.
- Expand `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to restore capability-first dispatch, workflow-contract layering, hidden skeleton, and display-gate discipline.
- Normalize explanations for `deps:install`, `discover:global`, `probe:clis`, `eval:agents`, and `verify:all`.
- Strengthen the canonical governance sources to make agent ownership explicit: only pure `Q / Query` may bypass agents, every executable task must have an owner, capability gaps now resolve through existing owner / Type B creation / temporary fallback owner.
- Add protocol-first dispatch requirements across the canonical sources: `runHeader`, `dispatchBoard`, `workerTaskPacket`, `workerResultPacket`, `reviewPacket`, `verificationPacket`, and `evolutionWritebackPacket`.
- Require explicit dependency / parallel-group / merge-owner planning so independent work must parallelize instead of drifting into unnecessary serial execution.
- Tighten Review and Evolution rules so protocol compliance and owner coverage are reviewed, and durable learnings must write back into agents, skills, or workflow contracts.
- Sync both README files to the stronger canonical rules: pure-query bypass only, owner-first execution, protocol-first dispatch, explicit parallel planning, and Evolution writeback to capability assets.
- Add a workflow relation map to both README files so the real project paths are easier to distinguish: pure-query bypass, simple owner-driven shortcut, Type C 8-stage spine, 10-step governance upgrade, meta 3-phase flow, and Type D review flow.
- Clarify the README concept layer in both languages: engineering is a governed domain of meta, but meta should orchestrate execution owners rather than pretending to be a single omnipotent engineer.
- Clarify the README architecture stance in both languages: Meta_Kim still keeps a chain-like spine, but now overlays it with hidden states, event controls, owner protocols, and parallel orchestration rather than remaining a pure linear flow.
- Move the “capability assets reduce repeated token cost over time” explanation into the early README sections in both languages so the long-term economic logic of the system is visible immediately.
- Harden the core method Mermaid diagram in both README files to use GitHub-friendly quoted labels, avoiding render failures around `Meta (元)` and other spaced node text.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Restore the two root README files to a more complete project-facing shape instead of the earlier over-compressed onboarding rewrite.
- Re-center the Chinese README on the `元` concept, preserving the original branding, concept explanation, contact block, support links, payment QR codes, and Mermaid diagrams.
- Bring `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` back into alignment with the current project design rather than leaving them as lighter onboarding-only summaries.
- Make the canonical governance sources explicit in documentation: `canonical/` plus `config/contracts/workflow-contract.json`.

### Added

- Canonical owner-first governance rules in `.claude/skills/meta-theory/references/dev-governance.md`: only pure `Q / Query` may bypass agents; every executable task must have an explicit owner.
- Explicit capability-gap resolution ladder: existing owner -> Type B owner creation/composition -> temporary `generalPurpose` owner with required justification and Evolution follow-up.
- Protocol-first dispatch requirements: `runHeader`, `dispatchBoard`, `workerTaskPacket`, `workerResultPacket`, `reviewPacket`, `verificationPacket`, and `evolutionWritebackPacket`.
- Parallelism requirements in the canonical sources: independent work must declare `dependsOn`, `parallelGroup`, and `mergeOwner` instead of defaulting to unnecessary serial execution.
- Evolution writeback rules that require each run to evaluate whether the current owner should be kept, adjusted, created, or retired.

### Synced

- Synced the strengthened canonical `meta-theory` skill and `dev-governance` reference into Codex mirrors, OpenClaw mirrors, shared skills, and workspace packs via `npm run sync:runtimes`.
- Synced the stronger owner-first / protocol-first / parallelism rules back into both public README files so outward-facing docs match the canonical project rules.
